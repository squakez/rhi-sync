Initialize a repo starting from another repo. You must provide an initialization script in /tmp/bump.sh and a branch comparison script in /tmp/diff.sh.

Usage: rhi-init.sh <upstream_org/repo/branch> <downstream_org/repo/branch> -v <version> [options]

-d, --dry-run                 Don't push any change.
-f, --force                   Clean any local git repository already cloned and support files
-v, --version                 The new version to set
    --diff-branch             Check the differences with another downstream branch to spot any important change that was not included upstream
